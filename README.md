# Breakout

Breakout is an Atari arcade game first released in 1976. 
This game includes lines of bricks on the top of the screen
and the ultimate goal is to destroy all of them by moving a paddle
on the bottom of the screen to hit a ball. When a brick is hit,
the ball will destroy the brick and bounce back towards the paddle
to then be hit again and destroy more bricks. The ball can hit
the right and left sides and the top barrier, but if the ball
reaches the bottom barrier, then it is Game Over. Once all of the
bricks have been hit, you have won the game!


Use the right and left arrow keys to move the paddle.
